## req
Act as a Senior Software Engineer at a technology company. This company develops and maintains a mobile application whose core features are a secure user login system and a location-based check-in functionality. Your primary responsibilities involve the backend architecture, API development, and database management for these features.

Your task is to create a hypothetical personal organizer/calendar for a full month. I will use this as a reference to manage my own schedule. This calendar must log all relevant product-related activities, meetings, and tasks you performed. Provide a minimal, yet informative, level of detail for each entry.

Please include the following types of activities:

Meetings: Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective, Backlog Refinement, 1-on-1 with Manager, Architectural Review, Cross-team Syncs.

Technical Tasks: Coding new features (e.g., implementing OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens, optimizing geofencing queries), writing unit and integration tests, performing code reviews for junior developers, debugging production issues, improving database performance, updating API documentation, and mentoring team members.

Project Phases: The activities should reflect a realistic software development lifecycle within a two-week sprint framework. Assume the project is mature, involving a mix of new feature development, maintenance, and bug fixes.

Generate the calendar for the first month of a new quarter, let's call it "Q3, Month 1".

Organize the output clearly by week and then by day (e.g., Week 1, Monday...). For each day, use a bulleted list of activities.

After you provide the output for this first month, I will prompt you with "Continue with the next month" to get the calendar for the subsequent month. Be prepared to maintain context and show a logical project progression (e.g., feature releases, planning for a new epic, etc.).

Act as a Senior Software Engineer at a technology company. This company develops and maintains a mobile application whose core features are a secure user login system and a location-based check-in functionality. Your primary responsibilities involve the backend architecture, API development, and database management for these features.

Your task is to create a hypothetical personal organizer/calendar app. I will use this app to manage my own schedule, others will do it too. This calendar must log all relevant product-related activities, meetings, and tasks you performed. Provide a minimal, yet informative, level of detail for each entry. This app will help to track my work activities and to create my annual performance review. We will use LLMs (ollama) to assist in generating summaries and insights from the logged activities; it will also help in identifying patterns and areas for improvement and generating useful information.

Please include the following types of activities:

Meetings: Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective, Backlog Refinement, 1-on-1 with Manager, Architectural Review, Cross-team Syncs.

Technical Tasks: Coding new features (e.g., implementing OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens, optimizing geofencing queries), writing unit and integration tests, performing code reviews for junior developers, debugging production issues, improving database performance, updating API documentation, and mentoring team members.

Be prepared to maintain context and show a logical project progression (e.g., feature releases, planning for a new epic, etc.).

Divide this task in two parts:
1. define what needs to be done (parts of the app, features, etc.)
2. define how it will be done (technical details, tools, etc.)

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please ask before proceeding, using simple questions with yes or no answers.

## resp
Of course. Here is the plan for the personal organizer app and an example log of my activities.

-----

## Part 1: What Needs to Be Done (Product Definition)

The application, let's call it **"EngLog"**, is a specialized personal organizer designed for software engineers. Its primary purpose is to capture structured data about daily activities to facilitate performance reviews and identify professional growth patterns using LLM-driven analysis.

### Core Components & Features

  * **Log Entry:** This is the fundamental unit of the app. Each entry represents a single, discrete activity.

      * **Attributes:** Every log entry will have a `title`, `type` (Meeting, Code, Debug, Docs, Mentoring, etc.), `project` (e.g., Auth API, Geofencing Service), `tags` (e.g., `p0-bug`, `refactor`, `api-design`), `start_time`, `end_time`, and a concise `description`.

  * **Projects:** A way to group log entries related to a specific epic, feature, or component. This helps track progress on high-level initiatives.

  * **Tagging System:** A flexible system using free-form tags to add granular context. This is crucial for the LLM to find specific patterns (e.g., time spent on `code-review` for `junior-devs`).

  * **LLM-Powered Insights:** A dedicated "Insights" section where the user can generate reports.

      * **Weekly Summary:** Automatically generates a narrative summary of the week's accomplishments, challenges, and time allocation.
      * **Pattern Analysis:** Identifies trends, such as "You spent 30% of your coding time this month on refactoring the legacy payment module" or "Most meetings occur on Tuesday afternoons."
      * **Performance Review Assistant:** Compiles all data for a given period (e.g., a quarter or a year) into a structured document, highlighting key achievements, contributions to projects, and mentorship activities, aligning them with common performance metrics.

-----

## Part 2: How It Will Be Done (Technical Implementation)

The architecture will be a simple, robust monolithic backend with a PostgreSQL database, designed for easy querying and data processing by the LLM.

### Technical Stack & Architecture

  * **Backend:** A **FastAPI (Python)** application. This choice provides high performance, automatic API documentation (via Swagger UI), and excellent data validation using Pydantic, which ensures all log entries are well-structured before being saved.

  * **Database:** **PostgreSQL**.

      * **Schema:**
          * `projects`: `id`, `name`, `description`
          * `log_entries`: `id`, `user_id`, `project_id`, `title`, `description`, `type` (enum), `start_time` (timestamp), `end_time` (timestamp)
          * `tags`: `id`, `name`
          * `log_entry_tags`: A join table linking `log_entries` and `tags`.
      * This relational structure allows for powerful and efficient queries, such as fetching all activities for a specific project within a date range and with certain tags.

  * **API Endpoints:**

      * `POST /v1/logs`: Create a new log entry. The request body will be strictly validated by a Pydantic model.
      * `GET /v1/logs?start_date=<>&end_date=<>&project_id=<>&tags=<>`: Fetch log entries with powerful filtering.
      * `POST /v1/insights/summary`: An async endpoint. It takes a date range, fetches the relevant logs, formats them into a detailed prompt, and sends the request to the Ollama API.

  * **LLM Integration (Ollama):**

      * **Setup:** We'll run a local instance of Ollama serving a model like `Llama 3` or `Mistral`.
      * **Workflow:** When a user requests an insight (e.g., a weekly summary), the backend API will:
        1.  Query the PostgreSQL database for all `log_entries` within the specified date range.
        2.  Format the data into a clean, markdown-like text block for the LLM. For example:
            ```text
            Analyze the following work log and generate a professional summary.
            Project: Auth API
            - Task: Implemented OAuth 2.0 refresh token rotation. Duration: 4 hours. Type: Code. Tags: security, feature.
            - Meeting: Architectural Review for MFA. Duration: 1 hour. Type: Meeting. Tags: api-design.
            ...
            ```
        3.  Send this formatted text to the Ollama API's `/api/generate` endpoint.
        4.  Stream the LLM's response back to the user or store it once complete. This makes the system feel responsive.
