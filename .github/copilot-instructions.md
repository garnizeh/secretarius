# EngLog Project Context

> "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad." - Cory House 🚀

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PROJECT DIRECTIVE ⚠️

**🎯 MANDATORY CONTEXT SYNCHRONIZATION RULE:**

**Every code change, feature addition, documentation update, configuration modification, or any project alteration MUST be immediately reflected in this PROJECT_CONTEXT.md document. This document is the single source of truth for the project state.**

**PRIORITY HIERARCHY:**

1. **HIGHEST PRIORITY**: Keep this context document synchronized with reality
2. **SECOND PRIORITY**: Implement the actual changes
3. **THIRD PRIORITY**: Everything else

**ENFORCEMENT:**

- Any commit without corresponding context updates is considered incomplete
- All pull requests must include PROJECT_CONTEXT.md updates
- Context accuracy is more important than feature velocity
- When in doubt, update the context first, implement second

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

- This document guides all AI assistance and development decisions
- Inaccurate context leads to misaligned implementations
- Team members rely on this for project understanding
- Future development depends on accurate project state representation
